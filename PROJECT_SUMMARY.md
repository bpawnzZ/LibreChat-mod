# LibreChat Technical Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

LibreChat follows a modern full-stack architecture with the following key components:

### Frontend (client/)
- React-based SPA using Vite as the build tool
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- State management using custom stores
- Modular component architecture in client/src/components
- Internationalization support via client/src/localization
- Comprehensive test suite using Jest

### Backend (api/)
- Node.js/Express server architecture
- Modular API structure with dedicated routes and controllers
- Multiple authentication strategies (JWT, OAuth, LDAP)
- Pluggable AI model integration system
- Caching layer with support for multiple backends (Redis, MongoDB)
- Comprehensive middleware system for request processing

### Core Services
1. Authentication & Authorization
   - Multiple auth strategies (api/strategies/)
   - JWT-based session management
   - Role-based access control

2. AI Model Integration
   - Support for multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
   - Pluggable endpoint system
   - Model-specific adapters and handlers

3. Data Management
   - MongoDB-based data persistence
   - Redis caching support
   - File storage and management

4. Real-time Features
   - WebSocket support for streaming responses
   - Real-time chat functionality
   - Event-based architecture

### Development & Deployment
- Docker support with multi-stage builds
- Kubernetes deployment via Helm charts
- Comprehensive E2E testing framework
- CI/CD pipeline support

## Key Features Implementation

### Conversation Management
- Branching conversation support
- Message editing and resubmission
- Context management system
- Conversation export/import

### AI Integration
- Multiple model support
- Streaming response handling
- Model switching mid-conversation
- Custom preset system

### Plugin System
- Modular plugin architecture
- Web access capabilities
- Image generation integration
- Custom plugin support

### Security
- Rate limiting
- Input sanitization
- Token management
- User authentication

## Data Flow

1. Client requests flow through:
   - Authentication middleware
   - Rate limiting
   - Request validation
   - Route handlers
   - Model-specific processors
   - Response formatting

2. AI model interactions:
   - Request preprocessing
   - Model selection
   - API calls
   - Response streaming
   - Error handling

3. Data persistence:
   - MongoDB for permanent storage
   - Redis for caching
   - File system for assets

## Configuration Management
- Environment-based configuration
- YAML-based model settings
- Docker environment variables
- Runtime configuration options

## Scalability Considerations
- Horizontal scaling support
- Cache layer optimization
- Database indexing
- Load balancing ready

## Security Architecture
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based authorization
- API key management
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- XSS protection
- CORS configuration

This technical architecture provides a robust foundation for the LibreChat application, enabling secure, scalable, and maintainable AI chat functionality across multiple models and providers.
